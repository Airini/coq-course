# Syllabus

Tentative Plan with 2 topics per session.

* Everyone presents at least one topic and prepares exercises for it.
* Feel free to add change topics and edit this file if you want to present some topic.
* I have planned  a more basic session on 16/02, since not all the participants have experience with proof assistants.
