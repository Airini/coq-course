# Syllabus

Tentative Plan with 2 topics per session.

* Everyone presents at least one topic and prepares exercises for it.
* If you want to present some topic, write your name in the presenter column!

  - You are encouraged to pick topics that you find of interest, even if they are not currently in the syllabus. 
  
  - If the topic is new, add your name and the title to the end of the table.  
    We can agree on a date and make space for your presentation during the next session. 
    
  - You can find many suggestions for topics in the [course plan](/plan.md).
* I have planned  a more basic session on 16/02, since not all the participants have experience with proof assistants.
