# Course plan

Each session covers some content with the objective of achieving some goals.
At the end of each session, we set exercises about what we covered to be
presented in the next session. We also make changes to the plan based on
what we have learnt, and what we have not.

Before each session, participants are expected to go through the material
on their own.
